[Resume/CV](../online-cv)

Thank you for visiting my persoal page.

Quite often when I use a new app or many types of technology I find that the concept is great, the underlying technology performs well, but the user experience (UX) is sub-par. And then I start thinking about how to make it better.

I'm that guy. Not unlike a copy editor who considers "trivial details" anything but trivial.

Call it a curse, call it a superpower, but when you are called to defend UX principles you have to answer the call.

By empathising with user of tech, we defenders employ our knowledge and methods eliminate app-killing pitfalls and turn them into pure delight.
