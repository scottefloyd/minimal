## USABILITY

### Photobook Usability Report

After the company I was working for entered the photobook market a customer survey was sent out to gain insight into customers' experience with the product. I coded the responses, paired responses with insights from the customer support team, and provided analysis on the product experience. My recommendations were put directly into the product development pipeline, which reduced the need for customer support in numerous areas.

## USER RESEARCH

### Competition App User Survey

In keeping with principles of Design Thinking, it better clarified what types of questions to ask and areas to explore in order to understand the needs of the user.

## TASK ANALYSIS

### City of Ann Arbor Website Task Analysis

I conducted a task analysis for the User Experience II course at Washtenaw Community College in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The city website at the time was quite dated and difficult to navigate. It was a good opportunity to dig into the issues and development more streamlined solutions. The report includes descriptions of the problems, and proposed solutions with design wireframes.
