## USABILITY

### Photobook Usability Report

After entering the photobook market, a customer survey was sent out to gain insight into customers' experience with the product. I coded the responses, paired responses with insights from the customer support team, and provided analysis on the product experience. My recommendations were put directly into the product development pipeline, which reduced the need for customer support in numberous areas.

## USER RESEARCH

### Competition App User Survey

I created a survey to gauge athlete interest in a competition app for extreme sports. The results provided useful feedback for the project. In keeping with principles of Design Thinking, by empathising with users, it better clarified what types of questions to ask and areas to explore to understand the needs of the user.
