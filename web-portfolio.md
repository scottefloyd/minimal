This website was developed for a photographer in Port Huron, MI. Kristy was a great client to work with. She is a high school art teacher and does graduation and personal branding photography during the summer. With Kristy's art background, she provided helpful feedback throughout the project. This website is not an out-of-the-box template, and is one of a kind.

I was contracted by Affinity Technology Group to develop this website. It is a static HTML website that required significant customization. The client was pleased with the result!


### Roy's Hardware

Roy's Hardware is a historic and iconic general store in the Traverse City region. They were long overdue for an updated web presence. Affinity Technology Group contracted me to develop their new site from start to finish.
